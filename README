NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::PerUser - Per user sessions (instead of per
    browser sessions).

SYNOPSIS
            use Catalyst qw/
                    Session
                    Authentication
                    Authentication::Store::Foo
                    Session::PerUser
            /;

            sub action : Local {
                    my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
                    $c->user_session->{foo} = "bar";
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin allows you to write e.g. shopping cart code which should
    behave well for guests as well as permanent users.

    The basic idea is both logged in and not logged in users can get the
    same benefits from sessions where it doesn't matter, but that logged in
    users can keep their sessions accross logins, and will even get the data
    they added/changed assimilated to their permanent account if they made
    the changes as guests and then logged in.

    This is probably most useful for e-commerce sites, where the shopping
    cart is typically used before login, and should be equally accessible to
    both guests and logged in users.

STORING SESSION DATA
    This module can store session data in two ways:

  Within the User
    If "$c->user->supports("session_data")" then
    "$c->user->get_session_data" and "$c->user->store_session_data($data)"
    are used to access and store the per-user session hash reference.

    This is useful for Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store
    implementations that rely on a database or another fast, extensible
    format.

  Within the Session Store
    If the user does not support the "session_data" feature, the
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store plugin in use will be used to save the
    session data instead.

    The session ID used to save this data is set by "user_session_sid".

    Note that this method could potentially have security issues if you
    override the default "user_session_sid" or "validate_session_id" in
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session. See "CAVEATS" for details.

METHODS
    user_session
        If no user is logged in, returns "$c->session".

        If a user is logged in, and "$user->supports("session_data")" it
        will return "$c->user->get_session_data". Otherwise it will return
        data from the normal session store, using "user_session_sid" as a
        session ID.

INTERNAL METHODS
    merge_session_to_user
        Uses Hash::Merge to merge the browser session into the user session,
        omitting the special keys from the browser session.

        Should be overloaded to e.g. merge shopping cart items more
        intelligently.

    user_session_sid
        By default returns

                "user:" . $c->user->id

EXTENDED METHODS
    set_authenticated
        Calls "merge_session_to_user".

CONFIGURATION
            $c->config->{user_session} = {
            ...
        };

    migrate
        Whether "$c->session" should be merged over "$c->user_session" on
        login. On by default.

    merge_type
        Passed to "set_behavior" in Hash::Merge. Defaults to
        "RIGHT_PRECEDENT".



    CAVEATS
        If you override "validate_session_id" in Catalyst::Plugin::Session
        make sure its format DOES NOT ALLOW the format returned by
        "user_session_sid", or malicious users could potentially set their
        cookies to have sessions formatted like a string returned by
        "user_session_sid", and steal or destroy another user's session
        without authenticating. =back
